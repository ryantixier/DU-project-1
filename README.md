# Dr. Drink: The Drink Recommender

## Description

The aim of the project was to create an interactive website that serves as an advertisment for a newly-opened bar. This application contains a variety of fun, interactive features:
<br>
</br>
(1) A customizable 'drink recommender' that will produce a list of drink options based on two user inputs: spirit type, and drink type.
</br>
<br>
(2) A 'random drink generator' that will provide the recipe of a randomly-selected drink, for those users who feel a little on the indecisive side while visiting the site.
</br>
<br>
(3) A 'save' feature that will allow the user to easily revisit past drink recipes they have liked.
</br>
<br>
(4) A 'history' section that details the backstories of the spirits available on the site; this section also allows the user to see more information about the bar's creation.
</br>
<br>
(5) Finally, an advisory section that provides links to helpful mental health resources related to crisis intervention, as well as treatment of substance dependence and abuse; we want our users to drink safely and responsibly!

## Usage

The information below details the functionality and instructions for use of the features mentioned above.

### Custom Drink Recommender

On the home page, the user is presented with the central platform of Dr. Drink: the drink recommender. Users will select a spirit and/or type of drink they would like to make from a dropdown of options; based on these user inputs, a clickable list of drink recommendations is generated in the center of the page, displaying the names of various drink options. Upon selection of one of these options, the drink name, ingredients, and directions on how to make the selected drink will appear on the right side of the page.

### Random Drink Generator

If the user is uncertain about what drink to make, or if they are having trouble selecting an option, they have the opportunity to have one randomly generated for them. The navigation bar features a "try me" category; clicking this will run the random drink generator, and will display the randomly picked drink in the informational section on the right side of the screen.

### Saved Drinks

Whether it be randomly generated or custom detailed, the user has the option to save drinks by name; when selecting a name/recipe, there is a button that allows the user to save the drink information to their local memory. These saved options display at the bottom of the page in list format, and will recall the recipe information (on the right side of the screen) upon clicking the drink name again. As mentioned, these saved drinks are stored in memory, so when the user navigates away from/revisits the page, their saved drinks will still display at the bottom of the page in a list format.

### History

This section displays options to select from the spirits featured on the website; selecting one of the thumbnails will provide a brief, historical synopsis of the chosen spirit. Additionally, there is a thumbnail labelled "About the Bar"; clicking this section will display a summary of the history of the bar itself.

### Advisory

The Dr. Drink site features two mental health/substance resources at the footer of the page. Upon click, the first link will direct the user to a site with information on how to receive treatment for alcohol addiction; the second link will direct the user to the suicide hotline site.
