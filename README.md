# Dr. Drink: The Drink Recommender

## Description

The aim of the project was to create an interactive website that would advertise a newly-opened bar. This application contains a variety of fun, interactive features:

<br>
(1) A 'custom drink generator' that will produce a list of drink options based on two user inputs: spirit type, and drink type. 
</br>
<br>
(2) A 'random drink generator' that will provide the recipe of a randomly-selected drink, for those users who feel a little on the indecisive side while visiting the site.
</br>
<br>
(3) A 'save' feature that will allow the user to easily revisit past drink recipes they have liked.
</br>
<br>
(4) A 'history' section that details the backstories of the spirits available on the site; this section also allows the user to see more information about the bar's creation.
</br>
<br>
(5) Finally, an advisory section that provides links to helpful mental health resources related to crisis intervention, as well as treatment of substance dependence and abuse; we want our users to drink safely and responsibly!
