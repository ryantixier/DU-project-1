        Founding and Early Years</h2>
    <p style="display:inline-flex" class="Gin-Paragraph">
        Gin is a distilled alcoholic beverage that has a storied history with roots tracing back to monks
        as early as the 13th Century. Monks would create medicinal tonics distilled from wine infused
        with juniper berries. At the time, juniper had been in a Dr.’s toolkit for centuries. Later in the 17th
        Century a Dutch physician, Franciscus Sylvius, has been widely credited with the creation of
        gin, however this is not true. A trade war and subsequent legislation to impose higher duties on
        imported spirits led to a resurgence in England. Gin distilled in England at the time was
        generally of poor quality and oftentimes infused with turpentine rather than juniper. The term
        “Dutch Courage” was coined around the same time as English soldiers would consume jenever
        before battle for its calming effects. By the mid-17th Century, the Dutch and Flemish had
        numerous distilleries around and had been redistilling malted barley spirit with juniper for years.
        In the 18th Century gin consumption rose greatly in England as the government allowed
        unlicensed distillation of neutral spirits. At the same time, the government also levied higher
        taxes on imported spirits again and the Gin Craze took off around 1695. Thousands of gin shops
        around England sprang up and were producing. The English government had to bring about 5
        legislative acts to combat the populations quench for gin. The Gin Act of 1736 led to massive
        riots, then was slowly reduced until it was finally absolved, the people won. Leaning into the
        19th Century and the invention of the column still, making distillation of neutral spirits much
        easier the “London Dry” style was born. Gin and Tonic was also created around the same time
        in British tropical colonies. At the time quinine was the only widely used antimalarial compound
        and was dissolved into carbonated water. Gin was added to this tonic and thus the Gin and
        Tonic we love today was born. Though today’s tonic only has traces of quinine for flavor.

        Whiskey in America</h3>
    <p class="Gin-Paragraph">
        During
        America’s prohibition era of the early 1900s, gin was commonly found available in speakeasies.
        Gin’s ease of production was one major reason as to why it was widely available at the time and
        this secretly produced gin was commonly referred to as “bathtub gin”. Moving into the 20th and
        21st centuries gin has taken off in popularity in many other markets than the English. The rise of
        gin liqueurs has aided in the explosion of popularity. There has been a massive surge in the
        number of distilleries, distilling gin. There has also been a rise in the addition of many new
        botanicals to recipes from different companies. That’s not to say that small production gin from
        private distillers in England doesn’t exist.
