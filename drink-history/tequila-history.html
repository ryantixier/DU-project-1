        Tequila is a distilled beverage that is immediately aged. Tequila traces its roots all the way back
        to 250 AD to its distant relative pulque which was a distilled alcoholic beverage using the agave
        plant as well. Tequila, however, can only be produced using blue agave whereas mezcal and
        pulque do not have the same stringent requirements. Blue agave grows exceptionally well in the
        red volcanic soils of the Jalisco State in Mexico. There are a few other municipalities that can
        produce it outside of Jalisco. Tequila primarily comes from in and around the town of Tequila in
        Mexico. The father of tequila is said to be Don Pedro Sanches de Teagle who is supposedly the
        first person to produce a product that is in the same style as what we call tequila today. Tequila
        production grew as King Phillip II banned the new plantings of wine grape vineyards in Jalisco’s
        highlands as to not combat the importation of Spanish wine thus diminishing his ability to collect
        on exportation taxes back home in Spain. The Spaniards did not care for pulque and started
        producing Vino de Mezcal. Eventually the Spanish would bring over copper stills and began
        distilling this mezcal drink. Later on what we know as modern tequila was born in the town of
        Tequila. By the late 1890’s tequila had become common to use when describing the mezcal
        spirit that originated in the town of Tequila and was quite different from other mezcal spirits of
        the time. In the 1930s and 1940s the Mexican film and music industries used tequila often to
        help promote more Mexican heritage. During the Spanish Influenza epidemic, tequila was said
        to be the greatest medicine to combat the flu.

    Tequila has quite a simple distillation process. The first step in producing tequila is harvesting
    the blue agave plant. Second step is baking the pina bulb. After baking the bulb you shred it in
    order to extract the juice. Once the juice has been extracted the juice is then fermented for 3-12
    days. After fermentation the juice is distilled and then aged. Tequila must be aged for 14-21
    days. This minimum aged product is blanco or silver tequila. Reposado has to be aged for two
    months to one year. Anejo has to be aged for one to three years where Extra Anejo has to be
    aged for over three years. To age the tequila and give it the golden color the tequila is aged in
    oak barrels.
